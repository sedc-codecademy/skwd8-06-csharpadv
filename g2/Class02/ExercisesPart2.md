# Quiz App ✍
A school is requesting a quiz app to be developed so that the students can log in, answer questions and get an automatic grade. The students can only solve the quiz once and the teachers can see the results of all the quizzes.
## Features 🔹
* Log in
  * A student or a teacher can log in
  * Usernames and passwords should be predefined ( created before hand in the system )
* Student logs in
  * A quiz pops up with 5 multiple choice questions ( 4 choices )
  * After the student picks a choice on the 5 answers a grade appears from 1 to 5
  * After that the user is logged out and another user can log in
  * If the same student tries to log in, it should say that they already did the test and log them out
* Teacher logs in
  * All students that did the quiz and have a grade show up in green

    * If a student answered all 5 questions correctly grade him as `Excellent`
    * If a student answered more than 3 questions correctly grade him as `Very Good`
    * If a student answered more than 1 question correctly grade him as `Good`
    * If a student didn't answered a single question correctly grade him as `Bad`
